# React Portfolio

A simple portolio page built using React JS. The app includes 'About Me', 'Portfolio', 'Contact', and 'Resume' pages, with a navbar in the header that links to each of them. 

The 'About Me' section contains a brief bio and a recent photo.

The 'Portfolio' page includes images of six of my recent projects, with links to their github repositories and deployed apps.

The 'Contact' page includes a form to submit an email (which has not yet been wired up, since it wasn't required for this assignment).

The 'Resume' page consists of a link to my resume and lists of my front and back end skills.

The footer includes links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and Stack Overflow accounts.
